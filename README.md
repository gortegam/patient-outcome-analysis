# 🏥 Patient Outcome Analysis

## 📌 Objective
This project analyzes hospital patient data to uncover patterns in length of stay, discharge status, and readmission. The goal is to derive actionable insights that could help healthcare administrators improve efficiency and patient care.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🗂️ Project Structure
- `data/` – Contains the raw or sample datasets used for analysis.
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter Notebooks with all the data exploration and visualizations.
- `src/` – (Optional) Python scripts or helper functions.
- `requirements.txt` – List of Python libraries needed to run the notebooks.
- `.gitignore` – Prevents unnecessary files (e.g., cache, checkpoints) from being tracked.
- `README.md` – Overview of the project.

## 📊 Key Questions Explored
- What is the average length of stay by diagnosis or age group?
- Are certain diagnoses more likely to result in readmission?
- Are there patterns in discharge status across patient types?

## 📈 Sample Insights
- Patients with [condition] have significantly longer stays.
- Readmission risk increases with age above [threshold].
- XYZ condition is most associated with early discharge.

*(This section will be updated as analysis progresses.)*

## 📁 Data
The dataset used is publicly available and does not contain any personally identifiable information. If you'd like to try it yourself, you can access a sample here: [link-to-dataset or Kaggle].

## 🩺 Why It Matters
Hospitals are constantly seeking ways to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. This project provides exploratory insights that can inform resource allocation and policy decisions in a healthcare setting.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add ML model to predict readmission risk
- Deploy dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI
